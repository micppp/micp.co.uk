Seems to be that time of the year again. When the gossip about the new iPhone goes in to over-drive.

If you do a google search for “iPhone5″ you will definitely get a massive amount of results all telling you something similar. The current rumours are that the 5 will be released in September – not October as the 4S was previously.

This falls perfectly in line with my phone contract upgrade so I’ll be getting myself one. It will be interesting to see what Apple put in their latest phone.

Talk has been that the iPhone5 will contain a quad-core processor and come with 4g technology (not that we can make use of it in the UK yet!).

The phone will be shipping with IOS6 which will also be available for older Apple devices. If you’re keeping your old iPhone and updating to IOS6 it might be worth leaving it 48 hours before you try and update. After my IOS5 update experience and problems I won’t be updating the iPhone4 I have straight away!

Here’s a few leaked shots of a production version of the iPhone5. It seems to be the width of the current metal band around the iPhone5. Has a different connector dock on the bottom which is causing a lot of manufacturers a little headache although I expect Apple to maybe ship with phone with an adapter so you can still connect the device to all old connection ports.
