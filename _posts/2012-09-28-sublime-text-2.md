When I started my new job I was faced with using Dreamweaver again for the first time in years. I’d left Dreamweaver at MX version and since used PHPEdit, Coda and Aptana for my coding UI.

As my previous blog post stated my new job was coding in Coldfusion and my UI of choice at the time was Aptana Studio which didn’t support .cfm or .cfc files which Coldfusion uses so I was forced with using Dreamweaver.

The white background slowly started to give me a headache. I’d been used to coding on a dark background for some time and found it a lot easier so after coming home one night with a massive headache I decided to have a look around to see if there was a program I could use.

A lot of thing suggested Eclipse which was also built for developing using Coldfusion but then I stumbled across Sublime Text 2.

After a swift download I opened my first .cfm file and noticed that there was no syntax highlighting. Back to square one I thought but it wasn’t! Another quick search of Google provided me with some instructions on how to enable Coldfusion support in Sublime Text.

Now Sublime Text is a an extremely light text-editor which loads in seconds (don’t believe me? Download it and see) but the extensions that are available for it are amazing and allow so much more which is why I’ve switched to the editor at home and work. There’s also a handy plugin which uses dropbox to sync your users folder so any files you have open in one location will open in the other. I’ve not gone this far because I like to keep my work and home work separate but this would be a nice feature for anyone who doesn’t.

You can download Sublime Text [here][1].  
Once downloaded I suggest the first thing you do is install the package manager.

Instructions can be found [here][2] and it’s as simple as opening Sublime Text and pasting the code in to the console window.
