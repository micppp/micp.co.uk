Well after many months of waiting (and a trip to Barcelona in between) tomorrow is finally the day I go on holiday!

I’m of to Tenerife for 7 days! I am staying [here][1] if anybody is actually interested. I’ve also just noticed the search button on the left; someone at Thomson is having a bad day there!

I’ve never been to Tenerife before and I enjoy going to new places so I’m looking forward to that. The fact it’s all inclusive also helps a little because I can sit in the sun all day drinking as much and eating as much as I want (this is going to ruin my recent diet).

As with all holidays the best (and worst) photo’s will be available online for everyone to take a look. I’ll shot a link up once I’m back and I have had time to process them all.
