After many different versions, changes and directions I have finally settled on a design which I like for my portfolio/blog.

Initially these were going to be two different things but after much thought I decided to stick them together. I can now blog my findings and showcase my portfolio of work in the same place.

And to anyone who cares â€“ the site is also responsive. So either fire up for your mobile phone or resize the browser window!
