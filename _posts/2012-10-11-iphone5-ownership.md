So I’ve had my iPhone5 for a little while now and after having a few doubts when I upgraded I’m now glad I made the jump from my iPhone4.

The phone arrived and the first thing I noticed was the new slimmer packaging the iPhone came in. I’ve always been amazed by Apples packaging and how everything seems so thought through.

Once I’d opened it and turned the device on the transfer of my back up was extremely quick. The new lightening cable seems to transfer data quicker than the old one – I’ve not actually looked whether this is true though so it could just be all my imagination.

The first things I instantly noticed was the weight difference from the iPhone4. This thing is a lot lighter and seems to fit my hand a lot better. Coupled with the new aluminum back I think these small changes make the phone better than the previous versions whilst still maintaining that style which we all associate with an Apple device.

The larger screen is a welcome addition to the phone and coupled with iOS6 there’s a large amount of new features. I’ve used to new Maps App once and successfully got to my destination so I’m not sure what all the fuss is about! My favorite new feature is Do not disturb – I’ve set it so from 23:00 – 07:00 my phone doesn’t pop up with any notifications to wake my when I’m trying to sleep – this means no more notifications of spam following me at 4am from Twitter.

Overall I love my new iPhone like a love every Apple device I own. I couldn’t imagine myself using another phone simply because everything is so simple and well thought out.

The only thing I am missing is the Jailbreak which I’m sure will come soon and another cable for work! However on that note I have just ordered a micro-usb to lightening adapter direct from Apple which can be seen [here][1].
