I’ve never really been one for saying goodbye. I like to think that the friends you make along the way will be friends forever and if your paths cross again it’s an excuse to catch up over a few beers!

Now as many of you reading this probably know, I start my new job tomorrow at Teesside University. After 2 years of being at Visualsoft it was a hard choice but one I had to make to further my career.

Over the 2 years I’ve made some awesome friends, made a lot of good memories and ate my way through a lot of fat Fridays! Due to these people I’d highly recommend Visualsoft to anyone looking for an e-commerce website.

I’d also like to say thanks for my [Incase Compact Backpack][1]. I’ve already used it on my little trip to Apple to get my iPhone sorted and it works a treat!
