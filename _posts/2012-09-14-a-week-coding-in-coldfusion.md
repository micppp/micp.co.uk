So I started my job this week working at Teesside University. This wasn’t the only thing new in my life this week. As I logged on to my machine – set everything up to how I like it I began the familiar task of looking around the files to see exactly how the Universities website was built.

Staring back at me was a language which looked totally new – ColdFusion. Now my previous experience of ColdFusion was that program I never opened that came with Macromedia’s MX suite.

After looking around a few files things starts to look familiar. I could see how variables were set. I could see if’s, loops and queries.

It’s been 4 days since I looked at my first ColdFusion file – the methods are the same as many other languages I’ve used over the years but it’s a whole new way of doing things and I’m really enjoying the change and challenge.

One of the perks to my new job is that I have access to the Universities library. A quick search on their system returned 10 books related a ColdFusion and a short walk later I had picked up a copy of [Adobe ColdFusion 8, Getting Started][1] (link is to an eBay auction I found were the book is insanely cheap).

Now I’ve read around about the first 100 pages and it deals with installation of ColdFusion and using the ColdFusion admin which makes connecting to databases extremely easy due the simple UI you’re presented with.

I’m hoping to finish most of the book by next week so I can get a better grasp on the language. I’d certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new simply due to the fact I’m enjoying it myself!
