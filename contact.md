If you have any questions or just wish to contact me you can either email me at [michael@micp.co.uk](michael@micp.co.uk) or you can probably catch me on twitter at [micppp](https://twitter.com/micppp).

###Projects

If you like my projects and you would like to take what I've put together further or you would like to use it please feel free to fork my code on github - [http://github.com/micppp](http://github.com/micppp). All I ask is that you let me know so I can take a look at what you're doing and probably wonder why I didn't think of that myself!
