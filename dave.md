# Instructions

Sign up here: https://www.ipvanish.com/

Just sign up for the 1 month plan, you'll then need to cancel within 7 days and you'll get a full refund.

Once you've signed up, install the software on your computer, open the application and log in.

One the application is open, click `server list` on the left hand side. Then sort by servers (best choice is usually the Netherlands).

Click on the number on the right hand side (next to the star) and it'll open the available servers in the netherlands.

Pick something with a smaller load percentage and a small ping (anything under 100ms is fine).

Double click on the server and connect. 

You'll then have to go to: https://www.bwfc.co.uk/ifollow/, sign up and pay for the game (i'll text you once I've done it with instructions on what to do here).

Go steal the chromecast from our mams or connect your laptop to the tv using a cable and you're good to go.
