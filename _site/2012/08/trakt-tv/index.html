	<h1></h1>

<p>Anybody who knows me well enough will know that I spend a large amount of my free time watching movies and TV series.</p>

<p>A few year ago I built myself a HTPC (Home Theatre PC). It basically looks like a DVD player but works like a computer. The PC runs Ubuntu and has XBMC (XBOX Media Centre) installed along with a few other plugins to make my life easier and to make sure that my library of TV shows is always up to date.</p>

<p>Now a few month back I was using a plugin called goMiso to record everything I watched – I liked the social aspect of the plugin. Being able to see what other people where watching and vice-versa.</p>

<p>That plugin however slowly became a massive pain to me. It would frequently crash, not load on startup or record that I was watching NULL on a regular basis.</p>

<p>This made me start to look around for an alternative which is where I came across <a href="http://trakt.tv/user/micp" title="My Trakt profile">trakt.tv</a>. After singing up and installing a few plugins I found this to be just what I needed. The plugin crawled my library and pulled in everything I had marked as watched, this then allowed me to logon to the site and see what other people where watching who had watched similar movies and tv series to myself.</p>

<p>I’ve been using Trakt for many months now without any issues. On startup it checks both my Movies and TV libraries for newly added / updated items and displays a nice little tweet when I start watching something so all my friends know what I’m up too!</p>

<p>If you look over to the right on the homepage you will now see I’ve added a recently watched section. I am basically making a call to the trakt API and pulling in my most recently watched with a few lines of code (I will share this at a later date once I’ve added a few more bits and pieces).</p>

<p>Anyway, if anybody is looking for somewhere social where they can share their media collections and find new movies and tv shows or old one’s which you may have forgotten about then I definitely recommend you check out trakt.</p>
