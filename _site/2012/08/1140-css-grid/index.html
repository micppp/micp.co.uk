<p>Responsive Web Design is a big thing in the web world at the minute. Having a website which responds to the resolution of the device it’s being viewed on is going to be standard practice soon.</p>

<p>Once upon a time we only had to design for desktop so websites which were wrapped in a container were fine. Now we have a range of devices that users can access the content from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>Tablets</li>
<li>Mobile phones</li>
</ul>


<p>I could sit and write all day about how it’s now important to serve up a different design for these 3 devices but I’m sure the majority of you already know.</p>

<p>I have had a few people ask me if I’ve used a CSS framework and the answer is yes. After looking at a few different frameworks I finally settled on the 1140 CSS Grid (<a href="http://cssgrid.net/" title="CSS  Grid">cssgrid.net</a>).</p>

<p>The grid is built up of 12 columns which all adapt depending on what the user has as their resolution. You’re able to choose a variety of different column choices for your layout as long as the column count adds up to 12.</p>

<p>So for an example my header is currently 8×4 columns and my footer is currently 4x4x4 which all equal 12.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a responsive framework to get your website up and running quickly then I’d suggest that you go and take a look at the 1140 grid.</p>

<p>There’s also a WordPress theme which is available <a href="http://dotma.cc/8Yqk" title="1140 WordPress theme">here</a> which is what I am using. This will basically strip your theme down to plain text and allow you to build it up from there. A little bit of knowledge about WordPress is required though. If you decide to use the framework and have any questions just pop me an email (address in the footer).</p>
