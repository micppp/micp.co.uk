I am Michael Pallister. I’m 25 years old and I am a Web Developer from Middlesbrough. I enjoy building websites and my passion is in front end development although I've got a quickly improving skillset when it comes to back-end development too.

I have been building websites and messing around with the web ever since I got a computer in my teens. I always knew from a young age that as I got older I would end up doing something that involved me using a computer on a daily basis.

I’ve worked on all kinds of projects ranging from small sites with a few pages to large complex dynamically driven e-commerce websites. Some of the skills I’ve developed along the way are:

* HTML(5)
* CSS(3)
* PHP
* mySQL
* Javascript/jQuery
* Adobe Colfusion
* .net
* Adobe Photoshop


I also have experience of working in a team, managing my own projects and my own workload whilst working towards tight deadlines.
